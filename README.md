# CMPE342_DB

This repository is made possible By <em>Assoc. Prof. Dr. Yıltan Bitirim</em>. I've added this code for sake of seeing codes 
more clearly without losing time for cumborsome typing. I suggest to type those codes again to understand it even more. Furthermore, it's 
sometimes better to see everything in order as a project.

Firstly in your vs 2019 interface we have to enable server explorer. Its view might be disabled by default.

Afterwards we have to create an SQL database to use in server explorer.

Afterwards must be shown clearly in your notes

'Data Source' must be Microsoft SQL Server Database File (SqlClient) by default, if by any chance it's not change it to exactly Microsoft
SQL Server DAtabase File (SqlClient) then Browse for database mdf file that you created.

On your Server Explorer tab you will see Database.mdf. You can right click on it and select "Add New Table".

After Selecting Add New Table you will be greeted with this where you can type the table properties to below and create your table and see if 
its working on webform1.
